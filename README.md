### Description

This is basically just the UUID generation code from the [Fox library](https://github.com/andreww/fox)/

This code is hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran

### Building

A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) manifest file is included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```

To use `uuid-fortran` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
uuid-fortran = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran.git" }
```

To generate the documentation using [ford](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford), run: ```ford ford.md```

To use `uuid-fortran` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
uuid-fortran = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran.git" }
```

Or to use a specific version:
```toml
[dependencies]
uuid-fortran = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran.git", tag = "1.0.0"  }
```

### Documentation

 * The API documentation for the current ```master``` branch can be found [here](https://jacobwilliams.github.io/uuid-fortran/).  This is generated by processing the source files with [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford).
