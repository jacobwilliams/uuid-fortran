============

UUID-Fortran: A modern Fortran module for generating UUIDs.

## Status

![Build Status](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

This is basically just the UUID generation code from the [Fox library](https://github.com/andreww/fox)/

This code is hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran

### Building

A [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) manifest file is included, so that the library and tests cases can be compiled with FPM. For example:

```
fpm build --profile release
fpm test --profile release
```

To use `uuid-fortran` within your fpm project, add the following to your `fpm.toml` file:
```toml
[dependencies]
uuid-fortran = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/uuid-fortran.git" }
```

To generate the documentation using [ford](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford), run: ```ford ford.md```
